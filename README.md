### EventTrackerProject

### Overview
This weekends project was sprintREST project where I used JSON and SpringREST to complete a Hiker Tracker application.
This application used Spring Data JPA to interact with databases, and implemented operations of create read update and delete data from databases.
This application tracked a hiker's activities. We can track a hiker's hiking distance, what day the hiking happened and where this happened. We can also track how frequently the hiker went hiking and what the favorite trails the hiker liked to go. What's more, from the history of people's hiking, we can get the information which trails are very popular in Colorado.

### Technologies Used

### Lessons Learned
It was a challenge to draw the EER Diagram of different tables. I spent a while to learn this tool and make it work perfect.
